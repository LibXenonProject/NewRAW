I have tried to make a runnable version of RAW -Another world Interpretor-

Actually, these things works :

- Protection Wheel
- In-game save and load
- Joystick
- Audio sound
- Bypass protection test=> on my personal dump


Things doesn't work :
 all ok

Things still buggy :

Sound

Original another world files should be put in "raw" directory
